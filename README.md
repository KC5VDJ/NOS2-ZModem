# NOS2-ZModem
Bringing NOS 2 into the late 80's.

There are already XMODEM and KERMIT.

NOS 2.8.7 is just begging for ZModem.  There are ZModem capable Telnet clients out there...

Suppose someone has DtCyber going, and wants to access using an older PC, by modem or null cable.  Odds are that either Procomm, or more likely, Telix will be used (or even minicomm on *ix).  ZModem is kinda the go-to here, pretty much from it's inception to the death of BBSs in general.

# NOS2-ZModem
Bringing NOS 2 into the late 80's.

There are already XMODEM and KERMIT.  XMODEM was fine for RBBS, but not much else.  kermit is handy, but arcane.  The former died long before NOS 2.8, pretty much once anything better was available.  kermit always had a small base, despite its power (because of?).

NOS 2.8.7 is just begging for ZModem.  There are ZModem capable Telnet clients out there...

Suppose someone has DtCyber going, and wants to access using an older (80s, early 90s) PC, by modem or null cable.  Odds are that either Procomm, or more likely, Telix will be used (or even minicomm on *ix).  ZModem is kinda the go-to here, pretty much from it's inception to the death of BBSs in general.

YMODEM was a curiosity and stopgap with bigger blocks and better error detection..  Did anyone ever keep using it after ZModem?  If there is a legit interest, I'll consider having YMODEM in this as well (kinda like rzsz's sb and rb, iirc).
